# Rhychord
 Rhythm game made in Godot as the basis of my final paper for my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. Featuring 5 songs and a tight time-keeping system.
 ## How to play
 Use the arrow keys or WASD to hit the notes that come from outside the screen. Hold the keys if the notes have a trail.
